## CSE110: Object Oriented Programming - Assignment 2

This repository contains the Java code for all the tasks included in **Assignment 2** of the **CSE110: Object Oriented Programming** course at **EAST WEST UNIVERSITY**.

### Assignment Overview:

The objective of this assignment is to enhance problem-solving skills related to object-oriented programming concepts. The tasks involve creating methods, method overloading, class and object creation, constructor usage, access modifiers, instance and static methods, and more.

**Tasks:**

- **âœ… 1. Palindrome Integer ([Palindrome.java](/app/src/main/java/academic/cse110/assignment02/tasks/T01_Palindrome.java))**
- **âœ… 2. Display Matrix of 0s and 1s ([Matrix.java](/app/src/main/java/academic/cse110/assignment02/tasks/T02_Matrix.java))**
- **ðŸš§ 3. Check Password ([Password.java](Password.java))**
- **ðŸš§ 4. Count the Letters in a String ([CountLetters.java](CountLetters.java))**
- **ðŸš§ 5. Occurrences of a Specified Character ([CountChar.java](CountChar.java))**
- **ðŸš§ 6. Stock Class ([Stock.java](Stock.java))**
- **ðŸš§ 7. Use the GregorianCalendar Class ([CalendarTest.java](CalendarTest.java))**
- **ðŸš§ 8. Stopwatch ([StopWatch.java](StopWatch.java))**
- **ðŸš§ 9. Algebra: 2 * 2 Linear Equations ([LinearEquation.java](LinearEquation.java))**
- **ðŸš§ 10. The Location Class ([Location.java](Location.java))**

**Menu-Driven Approach:**

This project utilizes a menu-driven approach for user interaction and task execution. The [`Main`](App.java) **class** serves as the **entry point** of the program and implements the following functionalities:

1. **Display a menu** listing all available tasks.
2. **Allow users to select a task** by entering the corresponding number.
3. **Execute the chosen task** based on the user's selection.
4. **Provide clear instructions and prompts** within each task.

This approach enhances the user experience and simplifies the interaction with the various functionalities implemented in the assignment.

**Complete Code Documentation:**

For the complete and formatted code of all implemented functionalities, please refer to the **"[assignments02-solutions](app/src/main/resources/assignment02-solutions.pdf)"** PDF.

**Accessible Problems:**

Detailed descriptions of the problems are available in the **"[assignment02-problems](app/src/main/resources/assignment02-problems.pdf)"** PDF.
